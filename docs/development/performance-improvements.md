# Performance Improvements Timeline

This document tracks the performance improvements made to the BarcodeGenerator library over time, including benchmark results and optimization details.

## Timeline

### August 17, 2025
- **Optimized Method**: `EanEncoder.FormatBarcode`
- **Description**: Optimized string manipulation algorithm by replacing PadLeft/slice pattern with conditional logic to avoid redundant operations for different input scenarios.
- **Performance Results**:
  - **Batch Processing**: Mean = 224.70 ns → 161.12 ns (28.3% faster)
  - **Single Long Barcode**: Mean = 20.12 ns → 11.75 ns (41.6% faster)
  - **Single Short Barcode**: Mean = 18.05 ns → 8.52 ns (52.8% faster)
  - **Padding Required**: Mean = 27.71 ns → 22.52 ns (18.7% faster)
- **Improvement**: 
  - **Up to 52.8% faster execution** for single short barcode operations (2.12x speedup)
  - **Consistent gains across all scenarios** (18.7% - 52.8% improvement range)
  - **Technical Impact**: Eliminated redundant PadLeft/slice operations, using direct string concatenation with conditional logic for optimal performance across EAN-13, EAN-8, ISBN-13, and UPC-A encoding scenarios

### August 16, 2025
- **Optimized Method**: `Encoder.GetSafeFilename`
- **Description**: Replaced LINQ-based character filtering with manual span-based processing and stack allocation for small buffers.
- **Performance Results**:
  - **Simple filename (baseline)**: Mean = 78.15 ns → 51.06 ns (34.7% faster)
  - **Complex filename (with invalid chars)**: Mean = 135.21 ns → 108.93 ns (19.4% faster)  
  - **Long filename**: Mean = 200.70 ns → 171.28 ns (14.7% faster)
- **Improvement**:
  - **Up to 34.7% faster execution** for common simple filename cases
  - **Reduced memory allocation** via stackalloc for files ≤256 characters
  - **Technical Impact**: Eliminated LINQ overhead and leveraged span-based processing for optimal performance across all filename scenarios

### August 16, 2025
- **Optimized Method**: `EncodersFactory.Create`
- **Description**: Replaced Activator.CreateInstance reflection calls with pre-populated factory delegate cache for direct constructor invocation.
- **Performance Results**:
  - **Before Optimization (Create_Old)**: Mean = 208.61 ns, Allocated = 544 B
  - **After Optimization (Create)**: Mean = 47.38 ns, Allocated = 200 B
- **Improvement**: 
  - **340% faster execution** (4.4x speed improvement)
  - **63% memory reduction** (2.7x less allocation)
  - **Technical Impact**: Eliminated reflection overhead for all known encoder types while maintaining extensibility through fallback pattern

### August 13, 2025
- **Optimized Method**: `EncodesExtensions.GetDisplayName`
- **Description**: Introduced caching and optimized attribute lookup to significantly improve performance.
- **Performance Results**:
  - **Before Optimization**: Mean = 370.7 ns, Allocated = 264 B
  - **After Optimization**: Mean = 1.931 ns, Allocated = 0 B
- **Improvement**: ~99.5% faster execution time and eliminated memory allocation.
