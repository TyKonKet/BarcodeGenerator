# Method Optimization Todo List

This document outlines the steps to follow for optimizing methods in the BarcodeGenerator library. It includes best practices and lessons learned from previous optimizations.

## Todo List for Method Optimization

1. **Duplicate the Method**:
   - Create a duplicate of the current method (e.g., `MethodName_Old`) for benchmarking purposes.
   - Ensure the duplicate is clearly marked as the old implementation.

2. **Set Up Benchmark**:
   - Use BenchmarkDotNet to create a benchmark comparing the original and optimized methods.
   - Ensure the benchmark is focused and isolates the method being optimized.

3. **Optimize the Method**:
   - Refactor the method to improve performance. Common techniques include:
     - Reducing memory allocations.
     - Using spans (`Span<T>` or `ReadOnlySpan<T>`) for efficient memory access.
     - Caching results to avoid redundant computations.
     - Replacing LINQ with more efficient loops where necessary.
   - Avoid premature optimization; focus on measurable improvements.

4. **Validate Correctness**:
   - Write unit tests to ensure the optimized method produces the same results as the original.
   - Test edge cases and invalid inputs to ensure robustness.

5. **Run Benchmarks**:
   - Execute the benchmarks to measure performance improvements.
   - Use the latest .NET version possible to ensure results are relevant and take advantage of runtime improvements.

6. **Document Results**:
   - Add the performance improvements to the `performance-improvements.md` file.
   - Include before/after metrics, a description of the changes, and the date of optimization.

7. **Remove the Old Method**:
   - Once validated and documented, remove the old method to clean up the codebase.

## Best Practices and Lessons Learned

- **Use the Latest .NET Version**:
  - Always run tests and benchmarks on the latest .NET version to leverage runtime optimizations.

- **Focus on Hotspots**:
  - Use profiling tools to identify performance-critical areas before optimizing.

- **Benchmark in Isolation**:
  - Ensure benchmarks are not affected by external factors (e.g., disk I/O, network latency).

- **Validate Incrementally**:
  - Test and benchmark after each significant change to catch regressions early.

- **Document Thoroughly**:
  - Keep a detailed record of changes and their impact to maintain a clear history of improvements.

By following these steps and best practices, you can ensure that method optimizations are effective, maintainable, and well-documented.
